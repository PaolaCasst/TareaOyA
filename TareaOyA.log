Package fancyhdr Warning: \headheight is too small (12.0pt): 
(fancyhdr)                Make it at least 14.49998pt, for example:
(fancyhdr)                \setlength{\headheight}{14.49998pt}.
(fancyhdr)                You might also make \topmargin smaller to compensate:

(fancyhdr)                \addtolength{\topmargin}{-2.49998pt}.

Dimensions can be in units of em, ex, in, pt, pc,
cm, mm, dd, cc, nd, nc, bp, or sp; but yours is a new one!
I'll assume that you meant to say pt, for printer's points.
To recover gracefully from this error, it's best to
delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2' to delete
two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)
